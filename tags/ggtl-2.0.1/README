GGTL 2.0 (preview)

GGTL is a library designed to make it easier to program games in
C. It provides an AI that is able to play most 2 player strategic
games. Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe, Reversi (aka Othello), Connect-4 and
Chess are all examples of games that can all be implemented using
GGTL. 

This version of GGTL has been rewritten from the ground up to be
more flexible, more extendible, and easier to use. Contrary to
previous versions, this version also has a test suite.

The provided Reversi and Nim extensions implement all the
game-specific callback functions GGTL's AI needs. Using one of
these extensions means you can have a game with a capable AI up
and running in next to no time. Doing so incurs no penalty in
flexibility, however--you can override any provided callback
functions with your own.

Regretfully, backward compatibility with previous versions had to
be sacrificed in order to meet the goals for this version.
Versions 1.x and 2.x can both be installed at the same time,
however, so updating programs to use the new version should be
relatively simple.

The core library documentation can be found in the ggtl(3)
manpage. The ggtl-reversi(3) and ggtl-nim(3) manpages should be
consulted for its extensions.
