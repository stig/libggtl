ggtl 2.0.0 @ 2005-07-16

  Only minor changes since 1.99.5:
  * re-arrange tests
  * update version number

ggtl 1.99.5 @ 2005-07-03

  Many minor changes, including:
  * consider warnings as errors
  * plan number of tests we are running
  * tidy up perl testing a bit
  * return with exit_status() from tests
  * config.h.in is generated. do not check it in
  * documentation updates 
  * use typedef GGTL_VTAB for 'struct ggtl_vtab'
  * remove unnused variable
  * do not check for sl header
  * fix link in configure.ac 
  * check for gettimeofday in addition to sys/time

ggtl 1.99.4 @ 2005-06-05

  * Added iterative deepening alpha-beta search. Uses
    gettimeofday() if available, else falls back to use time() 
  * ggtl_set()/ggtl_get() have replaced custom accessors
  * added tests for default run-time config options
  * added reversi trace test
  * use typedefs for important datatypes, and document them better
  * various code and documentation cleanups
  * skip tests if libtap is not present
  * fallback to running tests manually if 'prove' is not present

ggtl 1.99.3 @ 2005-05-15

  * Found and fixed a major bug in the alpha-beta search after
    testing against human players. Turns out it is very important
    to take the _first_ best move found in a search.
  * Reversi fitness is now a function of both available moves and
    captured pieces
  * fixed move accounting for special case when search is skipped
  * fixed bug that caused some tests to be skipped when building
    out of the source tree
  * fixed off-by-one bug in reversi move routine 
  * added -W and -Wall compiler flags and fixed warnings 
  * added some tests and performed some minor code cleanups

ggtl 1.99.2 @ 2005-04-30

  * Do not link ggtl with tap; use it only in the tests
  * Killed a bug that prohibited re-use of cached moves in
    the reversi extension. This caused it to use massive amounts
    of memory.
  * improve reversi-demo and add manpage for it
  * make AI skip search when only 1 move is available
  * kill duplication across the various AIs
  * added tests for trace 
  * clean up tests a bit and move to using recursive make for
    them

ggtl 1.99.1 @ 2005-04-16

  The main change in this release was that the ggtl_list
  container structure was split into the separate ggtl_mc and
  ggtl_sc structures. This allows for a little stricter typing,
  and makes it clearer what each function returns.

  Other changes include:
  * Added -release linker flag different versions can co-exist 
  * Added -no-undefined linker flag to allow building on cygwin
  * Added debian package generation
  * Various documentation improvements

ggtl 1.99 @ 2005-04-02

  This is a GGTL 2.0 preview release. 

  GGTL has been rewritten from the ground up to be more flexible,
  more extendible, and easier to use. It now ships with
  extensions for playing Reversi (of any size) and a very simple
  variety of Nim. The code is now stable, but some features are
  still missing and the API is still not entirely set in stone.

  Regretfully, backward compatibility with previous versions had
  to be sacrificed in order to meet the goals for this version.
  Versions 1.x and 2.x can both be installed at the same time,
  however, so updating programs to use the new version should be
  relatively simple.
