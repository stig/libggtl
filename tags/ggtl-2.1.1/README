GGTL 2.1.x 

GGTL is a library designed to make it easier to program games in
C. It provides an AI that is able to play most 2 player strategic
games. Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe, Reversi (aka Othello), Connect-4 and
Chess are all examples of games that can all be implemented using
GGTL. 

The provided Reversi and Nim extensions implement all the
game-specific callback functions GGTL's AI needs. Using one of
these extensions means you can have a game with a capable AI up
and running in next to no time. Doing so incurs no penalty in
flexibility, however--you can override any provided callback
function with your own.

The core library documentation can be found in the ggtl(3)
manpage. The reversi(3) and nim(3) manpages should be consulted
for its extensions.
